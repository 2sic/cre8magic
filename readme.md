# cre8magic for Oqtane – Professional Theme Design

> 🪄🪄🪄 Create Magic / Stunning / Amazing Designs on Oqtane 🪄🪄🪄

[Oqtane](https://www.oqtane.org/) is a Blazor based platform to create awesome solutions.
It is heavily inspired by the Site/Page/Module model used in DNN.
So it's almost ready to create awesome websites and CMS solutions.

But there are two missing pieces (☮️) to create amazing websites:

1. Real Content-Management features - which can be done with the extension [2sxc](https://2sxc.org)
1. Tools to make designing themes fast and professional - enter: **cre8magic**

> 🎨🖌️🎨 Cre8Magic makes Oqtane Designer-Friendly 🎨🖌️🎨
>  
> Cre8Magic combines very simple Razor code and lets you adjust everything through settings.
