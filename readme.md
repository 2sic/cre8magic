# Cre8Magic for Oqtane ‚Äì Professional Theme Design

> &nbsp;
> 
> Create Magic / Stunning / Amazing Designs on Oqtane
> 
> &nbsp;

[Oqtane](https://www.oqtane.org/) is a Blazor based platform to create awesome solutions. 

It is heavily inspired by the Site/Page/Module model used in DNN.
So it's almost ready to create awesome websites and CMS solutions. 

But for that there were two missing pieces (‚òÆÔ∏è)...

1. Real Content-Management features - which can be done with the extension [2sxc](https://2sxc.org)
1. Tools to make designing themes fast and professional - enter: **Cre8Magic** 

## Make Oqtane Designer-Friendly

As a designer, you need certain tools and workflows to be efficient, such as:

1. the ability to make a small change and then reload the page to see the result
1. the need to focus on the **what** (like the design), without wasting time on the **how** (like C# loops)
1. the ability to create variations of your work, such as other layouts which are similar
1. every tool you add (such as Cre8Magic) should help, but never restrict

These aspects are important for the productivity of every designer. 
Now if you've worked with Oqtane (or Blazor for that matter) you will quickly see that this is not possible. 
This means you can whatever you want, but there is a **lot of code** involved, and a **lot of time-consuming restarts**.

## How it Works

Cre8Magic combines very simple Razor code and lets you adjust everything through settings.
